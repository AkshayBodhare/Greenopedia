Old leaves break away from time to time and flowering occurs continuously. The coconut tree is called the 'Tree of Life' due to its variety of uses. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying, as well as in soaps and cosmetics.

It grows high and spreads well in the sandy soil.The flowers of the tree normally appear in the months of February and March.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fruiting season is mainly late spring to early fall (March to September), especially the summer. A few fruits mature in winter or early spring. The fruit can produce rubber.. A fomentation obtained from the leaves can be applied to the injuries and their juice can relieve the puffiness of the glands. Jackfruit is grown commercially and is perhaps the most widespread and economically important Artocarpus species, both providing fruit and functioning as a visual screen and ornamental.

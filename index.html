Old leaves break away from time to time and flowering occurs continuously. The coconut tree is called the 'Tree of Life' due to its variety of uses. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying, as well as in soaps and cosmetics.

The rapidly growing tree has variation in its size depending upon the characteristics of soil. It grows high and spreads well in the sandy soil.The flowers of the tree normally appear in the months of February and March.In the Northern Hemisphere, the fruiting season is mainly late spring to early fall (March to September), especially the summer. A few fruits mature in winter or early spring. The fruit can produce rubber.. A fomentation obtained from the leaves can be applied to the injuries and their juice can relieve the puffiness of the glands. Jackfruit is grown commercially and is perhaps the most widespread and economically important Artocarpus species, both providing fruit and functioning as a visual screen and ornamental.

Young trunks bear triangular shaped leaf scars that become more diamond-shaped with age. On older trees, aerial roots tend to be present at the base of the trunk. Yellow inflorescences can reach lengths of 3 feet, are heavily branched, bear small white blossoms, and grow among the leaves.

Guavas can bloom throughout the year in mild-winter areas, but the heaviest bloom occurs with the onset of warm weather in the spring. The exact time can vary from year to year depending on weather.It is native to the Caribbean, Central America and South America.It is easily pollinated by insects, mainly by the common honey bee, Apis mellifera.The plant is used in many different shampoo products for its scent. It is also becoming a popular bonsai species and is currently quite popular in India and Eastern Asia.
